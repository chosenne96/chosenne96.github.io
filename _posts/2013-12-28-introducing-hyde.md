I'm currently a Master's Candidate in the Department of Brain and Cognitive Sciences at <u>Seoul National University (SNU)</u>, South Korea. I have the fantastic opportunity to work under the supervision of <u>Prof. SangAh Lee</u>.


## 🔍 Research Focus

I'm fascinated in how we perceive and navigate space, and how our spatial experiences are ultimately represented and organized into memory structures.

**[Hippocampal Remapping: Mechanisms of Memory Separation and Integration](/hippocampal-remapping)**

My main research project explores the neural mechanisms of hippocampal remapping: how the hippocampus dynamically balances the need to separate overlapping memories and integrate related experiences into a cohesive map.


## 🎓 Academic Background

I hold a B.A. in Psychology from Chung-Ang University (CAU) in Seoul, where I graduated with Summa Cum Laude honors (GPA: 4.27/4.5!).

Even since my undergraduate years, I've been particularly passionate about the process of science—especially the designing of experimental paradigms and the data-driven verification of hypotheses.

### My research journey includes:

**[Brain and Cognition Community (BCSC) at SNU](/bcsc-snu)**: 
- Presented a poster on the topic of "Enhancement of Executive Function and Structural Brain Development in Bilinguals."

**[Academic Group '사색' at CAU](/sasang-cau)**: 
- Conducted a replication study on the effect of "Probability of Change on Change Detection performance in Visual Short-Term Memory."

**[Research Assistant (RA) at Prof. Yang-Seok Cho's Lab (Korea University)](/yangseok-cho-lab)**:
- Studied literature related to selective attention and top-down suppression.
- Assisted with EEG experiments.

**[Research Assistant (RA) at Prof. Soo-hyun Cho's Lab (Chung-Ang University)](/soohyun-cho-lab)**:
- Reviewed papers on number cognition and post-decision change phenomena.
- Handled fMRI preprocessing tasks using Python.
